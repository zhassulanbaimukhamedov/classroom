# Идея простая
#### Нужно организовать работу преподавателя и студентов, для проведения занятий. 
#### И это делается с помощью двух инструментов Github (https://github.com/), и GithubClassroom (https://classroom.github.com/).
<ul>
  <li>
<h3>Рабочее пространство преподавателя</h3>
<h4>У преподавателя есть список студнетов. Можно проверять домашние задания, делать заметки и корректировки.</h4>

</li>
<li>
  <h3>Рабочее пространство студента</h3>
  <h4>У студента уже формируется портфолио. Список своих индивидуальных репозиториев.</h4>
<img src="2.png" width="700" />
  </li>
</ul>

# Дальше я постараюсь пошагово описать
#### 1. Как настроить рабочий стол преподавателю. Как проверять работы студентов.
#### 2. Как работать студенту, как делать домашние задания


# Как мы работаем с GitHub на курсе React

Здесь я постараюсь описать возможность организации командной работы с Github. 

Преимущества:
 - Студенты могут освоить теорию на практике
 - Создать свое портфолио
 - Проверка домашних заданий преподавателем индивидуально
 - Корректировка исходно кода студента
